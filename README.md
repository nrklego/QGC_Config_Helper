The goal of the project is to create helper that allows to run QGC that will be configured for specifyc device and quiqly switch between configs/devices when it's necessary.

How to use: run QGC_Config_Generator.bat, fill what it asks and it will generate an INI config and batch file to run QGC with this config. In addition it generates a shortcut that can be placed to any specific folder(Desktop by default). This shortcut is already configured to run with admin rights. This is needed to create a symlink to the desired config.
